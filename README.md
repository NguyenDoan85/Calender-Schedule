# Calender-Schedule
A calender schedule to organize your day

## Things that I done
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

## Problem that I encountered
- The time stamp is not follow the current hour. It is 5 hours earlier of the current time.
